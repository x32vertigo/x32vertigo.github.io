            <ul>
                <li>Since my first year of undergraduate, I have been an active member of UofT's Seismic Design Team</li>
                <li>Our team's goal is to design a 5 foot Balsa wood tower, which is then tested under seismic load conditions at an international competition</li>
                <li>My role in the team is to assist the design process by finding ways in which we can optimize the tower</li>
                <li>One method for generating concepts for structures is performing Topology Optimization using a finite element analysis software called HyperWorks</li>
                <li>I have also written a genetic algorithm, which searches for the optimal bracing scheme of a truss-element structure, which I hope to make improvements on this year</li>
                <li>This year, we plan on developing an iterative algorithm that searches for redundant components in our tower's bracing scheme</li>
                <li>A GIF of the genetic algorithm running is shown below</li>
            </ul>
